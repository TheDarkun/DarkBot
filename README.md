## How to contribute
There is no need to be good at programming, you can just put up a decentish issue here https://github.com/TheDarkun/DarkBot/issues. Of course if you are a compenent programmer, you can assign one issue to yourself (feature, bugfix, etc.) and then create your own branch with prefix such as "feature/"
